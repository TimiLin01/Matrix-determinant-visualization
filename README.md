# Matrix determinant visualization
This is also a project of Mathematical Concepts Visualisation, to examine how do the determinants of nxn matrices distributed.

There are 5 java files:

Matrix.java: a general class defining the basic properties and operations on matrices.

MatrixException.java: a subclass of the RuntimeException class which should use to throw matrix-related exceptions.

GeneralMatrix.java: a subclass of Matrix which describes a general mxn real matrix.

TriMatrix.java: another subclass of Matrix which describes a nxn real tri-diagonal matrix.

Project3.java: a completely separate class which will use Matrix and its subclasses to collect some basic statistics involving random matrices.

And the VarGraph.pdf shows the distribution of determinants' variances.
